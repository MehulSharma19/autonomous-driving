<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repository contains the source code for self driving car based on NVDIA's model for self driving cars using Udacity's self driving car simulator and Python. This project has been inpired by my work on "Autonomous Driving via Accident Analytics -- “Learning How Not to Drive” project in the Technica+Research Track under Dr. Ming Lin of the University of Maryland,UMD Department of Computer Science.

## Usage

This repository contains the code for training a model that can be used to develop a self driving car. 
The training data can be developed using the Udacity's self-driving car simulator in the "Training mode".

</p>
Once the model has been trained on the pictures and data from the "Training mode" of Udacity's self-driving car simulator, it can be used to run the car in the "Autonomous mode". An example of the same is shown below.

## Built With

The code was built with Python 3.x and Udacity's self driving car simulator.
